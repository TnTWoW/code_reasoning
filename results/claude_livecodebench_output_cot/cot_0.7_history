The function findChampion is defined, which takes a 2D list (grid) as input.\\n2. The function is called with the input grid = [[0, 1], [0, 0]].\\n3. n is set to the length of grid, which is 2.\\n4. The function enters a loop that iterates over the rows (i from 0 to 1):\\n   - For i = 0:\\n     - t is initialized to 0\\n     - Inner loop iterates over columns (j from 0 to 1):\\n       - t += grid[0][0] (0) and then t += grid[0][1] (1)\\n     - After inner loop, t = 1\\n     - 1 is not equal to n - 1 (which is 1), so it continues to next iteration\\n   - For i = 1:\\n     - t is initialized to 0\\n     - Inner loop iterates over columns (j from 0 to 1):\\n       - t += grid[1][0] (0) and then t += grid[1][1] (0)\\n     - After inner loop, t = 0\\n     - 0 is not equal to n - 1 (which is 1), so it continues\\n5. The function completes without finding a row where t == n - 1, so it implicitly returns None.\\n\\nTherefore, the function returns None for the given input.\\n\\nAnswer:\\n```python\\nassert findChampion(grid = [[0, 1], [0, 0]]) == None\\n```\",\n        \"role\": \"assistant\"\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"created\": 1727627157,\n  \"model\": \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\",\n  \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"completion_tokens\": 374,\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 394,\n    \"total_tokens\": 768\n  }\n}"]

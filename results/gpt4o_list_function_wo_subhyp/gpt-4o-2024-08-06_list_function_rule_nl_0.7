Specifically, the first number in the subsequence should be less than the first number in the input list, and each subsequent number in the subsequence should be greater than or equal to the previous number in the subsequence.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to implement the function `fn`:\n\n1. **Identify the Target Condition**: The first number in the subsequence must be less than the first number of the input list. Let's call this number `first_input`.\n\n2. **Iterate Over the List**: We need to iterate over the list to find potential starting points for the subsequence that satisfy the condition of being less than `first_input`.\n\n3. **Build Subsequences**: For each valid starting point, build a subsequence by adding numbers that are greater than or equal to the last number added to the subsequence.\n\n4. **Track the Longest Subsequence**: Keep track of the longest subsequence found that satisfies the conditions.\n\n5. **Return the Longest Subsequence**: After iterating through the list, return the longest subsequence found.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef fn(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return []\n    \n    first_input = nums[0]\n    longest_subseq = []\n    \n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] < first_input:\n            current_subseq = [nums[i]]\n            last_num = nums[i]\n            \n            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):\n                if nums[j] >= last_num:\n                    current_subseq.append(nums[j])\n                    last_num = nums[j]\n            \n            if len(current_subseq) > len(longest_subseq):\n                longest_subseq = current_subseq\n    \n    return longest_subseq\n\n# Example usage:\n# input_list = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n# print(fn(input_list))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initialization**: We start by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, we return an empty list since there are no subsequences to extract.\n\n- **Iterate and Check**: For each element in the list, if it is less than `first_input`, it becomes a candidate for the start of a new subsequence.\n\n- **Build Subsequence**: From each valid starting point, we build a subsequence by iterating through the rest of the list and adding numbers that are greater than or equal to the last number added to the subsequence.\n\n- **Update Longest Subsequence**: If the current subsequence is longer than the previously recorded longest subsequence, we update the longest subsequence.\n\n- **Return Result**: Finally, we return the longest subsequence found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the longest subsequence that meets the specified conditions.",

Here's how you can achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef fn(lst):\n    # Extract elements at even indices\n    even_indexed_elements = [lst[i] for i in range(0, len(lst), 2)]\n    \n    # Sort the even-indexed elements\n    even_indexed_elements.sort()\n    \n    # Create a new list to store the result\n    result = lst[:]\n    \n    # Replace elements at even indices with the sorted elements\n    even_index = 0\n    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):\n        result[i] = even_indexed_elements[even_index]\n        even_index += 1\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_list = [5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4]\noutput_list = fn(input_list)\nprint(output_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 2, 8, 5, 4]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Extract Even-Indexed Elements**: We first extract all elements from the list that are located at even indices. This is done using a list comprehension that iterates over the range of indices with a step of 2.\n\n2. **Sort the Extracted Elements**: We then sort the list of even-indexed elements.\n\n3. **Reconstruct the Result List**: We create a copy of the original list to store the result. We iterate over the even indices again and replace the elements at these indices with the sorted elements.\n\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the modified list, which has the even-indexed elements sorted while the odd-indexed elements remain in their original positions.",

If `0` is found, `index` returns its position.\n- We then slice the list from the position immediately after the found `0` to the end of the list.\n- If `0` is not found, the `index` method raises a `ValueError`, which we catch to return an empty list.",

Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef fn(lst):\n    if not lst:\n        return lst\n    \n    # Find the first sequence that is not strictly increasing\n    start = None\n    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):\n        if lst[i] >= lst[i + 1]:\n            if start is None:\n                start = i\n            # Continue until the sequence is no longer non-increasing\n            while i + 1 < len(lst) and lst[i] >= lst[i + 1]:\n                i += 1\n            # Sort the identified sequence\n            lst[start:i + 1] = sorted(lst[start:i + 1])\n            break\n    \n    return lst\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(fn([1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nprint(fn([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]))        # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(fn([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))        # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nprint(fn([]))                     # Output: []\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Edge Case Handling**: If the list is empty, we return it immediately as there's nothing to process.\n\n2. **Identifying the Sequence**: We iterate through the list to find the first occurrence where the current element is not less than the next element (`lst[i] >= lst[i + 1]`). This marks the start of the non-increasing sequence.\n\n3. **Extending the Sequence**: Once the start of the sequence is found, we continue to extend this sequence until we find an element that is less than the next one, indicating the end of the non-increasing sequence.\n\n4. **Sorting the Sequence**: We sort the identified sequence in place using Python's built-in `sorted()` function.\n\n5. **Return the Modified List**: Finally, we return the modified list with the first non-increasing sequence sorted in increasing order.\n\nThis function efficiently identifies and sorts the first non-increasing sequence while leaving the rest of the list unchanged.",

Return the modified list.\n\nHere's the Python function implementing this logic:\n\n```python\ndef fn(input_list):\n    # Step 1: Remove the first element\n    if not input_list:\n        return []  # Return an empty list if the input list is empty\n    \n    modified_list = input_list[1:]\n    \n    # Step 2: Find the second occurrence of 9\n    count_nine = 0\n    second_nine_index = None\n    \n    for index, value in enumerate(modified_list):\n        if value == 9:\n            count_nine += 1\n            if count_nine == 2:\n                second_nine_index = index\n                break\n    \n    # Step 3: Remove elements after the second occurrence of 9\n    if second_nine_index is not None:\n        modified_list = modified_list[:second_nine_index + 1]\n    \n    # Step 4: Return the modified list\n    return modified_list\n\n# Example usage:\n# input_list = [5, 3, 9, 2, 9, 4, 6]\n# print(fn(input_list))  # Output: [3, 9, 2, 9]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Step 1**: We first check if the input list is empty. If it is, we return an empty list. Otherwise, we remove the first element using slicing (`input_list[1:]`).\n  \n- **Step 2**: We iterate over the modified list to find the second occurrence of the number 9. We keep a counter `count_nine` to track how many times 9 has appeared. When the counter reaches 2, we store the index of this occurrence in `second_nine_index` and break out of the loop.\n\n- **Step 3**: If we found a second occurrence of 9, we slice the list up to and including this index (`modified_list[:second_nine_index + 1]`).\n\n- **Step 4**: Finally, we return the modified list.",

The loop runs until the second last element because we are checking pairs of consecutive numbers.\n\n3. **Appending Current Number**: For each element in the list, we first append it to the `result`.\n\n4. **Checking and Expanding Pairs**: We check if the current number is smaller than the next number. If it is, we use a `for` loop to append all numbers between the current and the next number to the `result`.\n\n5. **Appending Last Element**: After the loop, we append the last element of the input list to the `result` to ensure the last number is included.\n\n6. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `result` list.\n\nThis function handles the requirement of expanding sections between consecutive numbers where the first is smaller than the second, and it returns the modified list accordingly.",

This dictionary will map specific input values to their corresponding output values. If an input value is not found in the dictionary, we can apply a default transformation or return the input value unchanged.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```python\ndef fn(input_list):\n    # Define a mapping dictionary for specific transformations\n    transformation_map = {\n        1: 10,\n        2: 20,\n        3: 30,\n        4: 40,\n        5: 50,\n        # Add more mappings as needed\n    }\n    \n    # Define a default transformation function for unmapped values\n    def default_transformation(x):\n        # Example: return the negative of the input value\n        return -x\n    \n    # Transform the input list based on the mapping and default transformation\n    output_list = []\n    for item in input_list:\n        if item in transformation_map:\n            # Use the mapped value if it exists\n            output_list.append(transformation_map[item])\n        else:\n            # Apply the default transformation if no mapping exists\n            output_list.append(default_transformation(item))\n    \n    return output_list\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_data = [1, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4]\noutput_data = fn(input_data)\nprint(output_data)  # Output: [10, 20, -6, 30, -7, 40]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Mapping Dictionary**: We use a dictionary `transformation_map` to define specific transformations for certain input values. For example, the input value `1` is mapped to `10`, `2` to `20`, and so on.\n- **Default Transformation**: For input values not present in the dictionary, we apply a default transformation. In this example, the default transformation is to return the negative of the input value.\n- **Transformation Logic**: We iterate over each element in the input list. If the element is found in the dictionary, we append the mapped value to the output list. Otherwise, we apply the default transformation.\n\nThis approach allows for flexible and contextual transformations based on predefined rules and conditions. You can modify the dictionary and default transformation function to suit your specific requirements.",

Find the first number `n` such that `n` is not in the set of modulo results. The missing number in the sequence 1 to 10 is `n + 1`.\n\n4. **Construct the Output List**: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10, excluding the missing number identified in the previous step.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef fn(input_list):\n    # Step 1: Initialize a set to store modulo 10 results\n    modulo_set = set()\n    \n    # Step 2: Compute modulo 10 for each number in the input list\n    for number in input_list:\n        modulo_set.add(number % 10)\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine the missing number\n    missing_number = None\n    for n in range(10):\n        if n not in modulo_set:\n            missing_number = n + 1\n            break\n    \n    # Step 4: Construct the output list\n    output_list = [i for i in range(1, 11) if i != missing_number]\n    \n    return output_list\n\n# Example usage:\n# input_list = [12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89, 90, 101]\n# The output should be the sequence 1 to 10 with one number missing\n# based on the modulo 10 results of the input list.\n```\n\nThis function will correctly identify the missing number in the sequence 1 to 10 based on the modulo 10 results of the input list and return the sequence with that number excluded.",

Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef fn(input_list):\n    if not input_list:\n        return []\n    \n    max_so_far = input_list[0]\n    output_list = [max_so_far]\n    \n    for num in input_list[1:]:\n        if num > max_so_far:\n            max_so_far = num\n        output_list.append(max_so_far)\n    \n    return output_list\n\n# Example usage:\n# input_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\n# print(fn(input_list))  # Output: [3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We start by checking if the input list is empty. If it is, we return an empty list since there are no elements to process.\n2. **Tracking Maximum**: We initialize `max_so_far` with the first element of the list and start the output list with this value.\n3. **Iterate and Update**: We iterate over the rest of the input list. For each element, we check if it is greater than `max_so_far`. If it is, we update `max_so_far` to this new value.\n4. **Build Output**: We append the current `max_so_far` to the output list for each element in the input list.\n5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the output list which contains the maximum values up to each index.\n\nThis approach ensures that each element in the output list is the maximum of all elements encountered up to that point in the input list.",

The median is the middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n\nHere's how you can implement this function:\n\n```python\ndef fn(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return []  # Return an empty list if the input list is empty\n\n    # Sort the list to find the median\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n    n = len(sorted_numbers)\n    \n    # Calculate the median\n    if n % 2 == 1:\n        # Odd number of elements, take the middle one\n        median = sorted_numbers[n // 2]\n    else:\n        # Even number of elements, take the average of the two middle ones\n        median = (sorted_numbers[n // 2 - 1] + sorted_numbers[n // 2]) / 2\n    \n    # Collect numbers greater than or equal to the median\n    result = [num for num in numbers if num >= median]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\n# input_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\n# print(fn(input_list))  # Output: [5, 9, 6, 5, 5]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Check for Empty List**: If the input list is empty, we immediately return an empty list.\n\n2. **Sort the List**: We sort the list to find the median. Sorting is necessary because the median is defined in terms of the order of numbers.\n\n3. **Calculate the Median**:\n   - If the number of elements (`n`) is odd, the median is the middle element of the sorted list.\n   - If `n` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We use a list comprehension to filter out numbers from the original list that are greater than or equal to the median.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: The filtered list is returned as the output.\n\nThis function handles both odd and even-length lists and maintains the order of elements as they appear in the input list.",

Return the largest numbers in descending order followed by the smallest numbers in ascending order.\n\nLet's implement this in the function `fn`:\n\n```python\ndef fn(numbers):\n    if not numbers:\n        return []\n    \n    # Sort the numbers\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n    \n    # Determine the threshold for largest and smallest numbers\n    n = len(numbers)\n    threshold = max(1, n // 10)  # Use 10% of the list size, at least 1\n    \n    # Get the largest and smallest numbers\n    largest = sorted_numbers[-threshold:]\n    smallest = sorted_numbers[:threshold]\n    \n    # Return largest in descending order followed by smallest in ascending order\n    return sorted(largest, reverse=True) + sorted(smallest)\n\n# Example usage:\n# input_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]\n# print(fn(input_list))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sorting**: We first sort the list to easily access the largest and smallest elements.\n- **Threshold**: We use 10% of the list size as a threshold to determine how many elements to take from each end. This is a simple heuristic and can be adjusted based on specific requirements.\n- **Selection**: We select the largest and smallest elements based on the threshold.\n- **Output**: We return the largest numbers in descending order followed by the smallest numbers in ascending order.\n\nThis function should work well for a variety of input sizes, providing a balanced selection of extreme values. Adjust the threshold calculation as needed to better fit specific use cases or input characteristics.",

We also need to handle consecutive duplicates by removing them.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify Subsequences**: Traverse the list to identify subsequences that are either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n2. **Extend Subsequences**: Once a subsequence is identified, extend it by continuing the sequence in the same direction until the next number in the input list or until it reaches the boundary (highest or lowest number in the subsequence).\n\n3. **Handle Consecutive Duplicates**: If a number repeats consecutively, it indicates the end of the sequence. Remove duplicates when the number repeats consecutively.\n\n4. **Continue the Process**: Continue this process for the entire input list to generate the output list.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function `fn`:\n\n```python\ndef fn(input_list):\n    if not input_list:\n        return []\n\n    output_list = []\n    i = 0\n    n = len(input_list)\n\n    while i < n:\n        # Start a new subsequence\n        start = i\n        while i + 1 < n and input_list[i] == input_list[i + 1]:\n            i += 1  # Skip consecutive duplicates\n        if i + 1 < n:\n            if input_list[i] < input_list[i + 1]:\n                # Increasing subsequence\n                while i + 1 < n and input_list[i] < input_list[i + 1]:\n                    i += 1\n                max_val = input_list[i]\n                # Extend the sequence\n                while max_val in input_list[start:i+1]:\n                    output_list.append(max_val)\n                    max_val += 1\n            elif input_list[i] > input_list[i + 1]:\n                # Decreasing subsequence\n                while i + 1 < n and input_list[i] > input_list[i + 1]:\n                    i += 1\n                min_val = input_list[i]\n                # Extend the sequence\n                while min_val in input_list[start:i+1]:\n                    output_list.append(min_val)\n                    min_val -= 1\n        # Add the last element of the subsequence\n        output_list.append(input_list[i])\n        i += 1\n\n    return output_list\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_list = [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 5, 6]\nprint(fn(input_list))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Initialization**: We initialize `output_list` to store the result and use `i` to iterate through the input list.\n\n- **Subsequence Identification**: We identify subsequences by comparing consecutive elements. If they are equal, we skip them to handle consecutive duplicates.\n\n- **Subsequence Extension**: For increasing subsequences, we extend by incrementing the maximum value found in the subsequence. For decreasing subsequences, we extend by decrementing the minimum value.\n\n- **Appending to Output**: We append the extended values to `output_list` and continue the process until the end of the input list.\n\nThis function should correctly process the input list according to the specified rule and generate the desired output list.",

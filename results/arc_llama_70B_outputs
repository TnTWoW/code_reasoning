The list comprehension iterates over each pair of indices `i` and `j` in the input list `x`.\n2. For each pair, it calculates the maximum value between `x[i]` and `x[j]`. If `i` is not equal to `j`, it takes the maximum value; otherwise, it sets the value to 0.\n3. The resulting list is flattened using a single list comprehension.\n4.

The goal is to return a new list of lists where each inner list is the same as the corresponding inner list in the input, but with the order of the elements preserved.\n\nThe solution is quite simple: we use slicing to extract the inner lists in reverse order, and return the resulting list of lists.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the slicing notation `x[-1::-1]`:\n\n* `x[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `x`.\n* `x[::-1]` refers to the entire list `x` in reverse order.\n* By combining the two, we get `x[-1::-1]`, which extracts the inner lists in reverse order, preserving their original order.\n\nLet's test the function with the provided examples:\n```python\nx1 = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n      [0, 0, 0, 0, ",

The goal is to shift the list of lists up by one row, wrapping around to the top when reaching the end.\n\nThe expression `x[-1:]` takes the last row of the input list (i.e., the last element of the list of lists).\n\nThe expression `x[:-1]` takes all rows except the last one (i.e., everything except the last element of the list of lists).\n\nBy concatenating these two expressions using the `+` operator, we effectively shift the list of lists up by one row, wrapping around to the top when reaching the end.\n\nFor example, given the input `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, ",

The goal is to return a new list of lists where each inner list is the same as the corresponding inner list in the input, but with the order of the elements preserved.\n\nThe trick here is to use slicing with a step of -1, which reverses the order of the elements in each inner list. By starting from the end of the list (`-1`) and moving backwards to the beginning (`::-1`), we effectively preserve the original order of the elements.\n\nFor example, if the input is `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]]`, the output will be `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, ",

If it's not the first occurrence, the last occurrence of that sublist in the output list is repeated.\n\nHere is the Python function that solves the problem:\n\n```python\ndef fn(x):\n    output = []\n    seen = {}\n    for sublist in x:\n        sublist_tuple = tuple(sublist)\n        if sublist_tuple not in seen:\n            seen[sublist_tuple] = True\n            output.append(sublist)\n        else:\n            output.append(output[-1])\n    return output\n```\n\nThis function uses a dictionary `seen` to keep track of the sublists that have been seen before. For each sublist in the input, it converts the sublist to a tuple (because lists are not hashable and cannot be used as dictionary keys) and checks if it's in the `seen` dictionary. If it's not, it adds the sublist to the output list and marks it as seen. If it is, it appends the last sublist",

The `[::-1]` syntax is used to reverse the order of the lists in `x`. This is done by slicing the list with a step of -1, which means \"start from the end and move backwards\".\n\nFor example, if `x` is `[[1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`, then `x[::-1]` would return `[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0",

We find the maximum and minimum values in the input list `x` using the `max` and `min` functions.\n2. We use a list comprehension to create a new list with the transformed values.\n3. For each element `i` in the input list, we apply the following rule:\n\t* If `i` is equal to the maximum value, we replace it with the minimum value.\n\t* If `i` is equal to the minimum value, we replace it with the maximum value.\n\t* Otherwise, we leave the value unchanged.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided input examples to verify that it produces the expected outputs.",

The function takes a list `x` as input.\n2. We iterate through each element `i` in the list using `range(len(x))`.\n3. For each element, we check if it's non-zero (`x[i]!= 0`) and if it appears more than once in the list (`x.count(x[i]) > 1`).\n4. If both conditions are true, we set the element to 1 (`x[i] = 1`).\n5.

First, we find the number with the maximum count in the input list `x`. We use a `set` to get the unique numbers, and then iterate through them to find the one with the maximum count.\n2. We then create a new list `result` by iterating through the original input list `x`. For each number, if it's the maximum count number, we append it to the result list. Otherwise, we append the smallest number that's not the maximum count number (found using `min(set(x) - {max_num})`).\n3. Finally, we return the resulting list `result`.\n\nYou can test",

We use a list comprehension to create a new list with the desired output.\n\nFor each input list `x`, we check if the number of 3's in the list is exactly 2. If it is, we return the original list `x`. Otherwise, we return a list of zeros with the same length as `x`.\n\nThe `sum(i == 3 for i in x) == 2` part counts the number of 3's in the list `x`. The `[0]*len(x)` part creates a list of zeros with the same length as `x`.\n\nNote that the `[x]` in the list comprehension is used to iterate over a list containing only the input list `x`. This is because the problem statement suggests that the input is a single list, and we need to process it as a whole.",

If the element is 3 and it's either the first element or the previous element is 0, and it's either the last element or the next element is 0, then it keeps the element as 3. Otherwise, it sets the element to 0. Finally, it returns the modified list.\n\nYou can test this function with the provided inputs to verify that it produces the correct outputs.",

The function takes a list `x` as input.\n2. The list comprehension iterates over each element of `x`, but ignores the element value and only considers the presence and count of 3's in the list.\n3. If the list `x` contains exactly 2 occurrences of 3, the function returns a list with the same shape as `x`, but with all elements set to 0, except for the positions where the original list had a 3.\n4.

Then, it iterates over the rows and columns of the input list, starting from the second row and column, and assigns the values from the input list to the corresponding positions in the output list, but in a mirrored fashion.\n\nFor example, if you call `fn([[1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [2, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, ",

The inner loop iterates over the columns of `x`, starting from the second column (index 1) and ending at the second-to-last column (index -1).\n\nFor each element `x[i][j]` that is equal to 4, we check if its top, left, and right neighbors are also equal to 4. If all these conditions are true, we set `x[i][j]` to 6.\n\nFinally, the function returns the modified 2D list `x",
          "Here is a Python function that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs:\n\n```python\ndef fn(x):\n    for i in range(1, len(x)):\n        for j in range(1, len(x[0]) - 1):\n            if x[i][j] == 4:\n                x[i][j] = 6\n    return x\n```\n\nThis function iterates over the input list of lists, excluding the first and last elements of each sublist. If it finds a 4, it replaces it with a 6. The result is the modified list of lists.\n\nNote that this function modifies the input list in place. If you want to preserve the original input and return a new list, you can modify the function to create a copy of the input list at the beginning:\n\n```python\ndef fn(x):\n    x = [row.copy() for row in x]\n    for i in range(1, len(x)):\n        for j in range(1, len(x[0]) - 1):\n            if x[i][j] == 4:\n                x[i][j] = 6\n    return x\n```"

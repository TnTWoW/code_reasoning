It creates a prefix sum array.\n4. It initializes some variables, including two Counters.\n5. The main loop iterates through the list, updating dp and prev.\n6. The function returns n - dp[n], where n is the length of the original list.\n\nTo get an output of 1, we need n - dp[n] = 1, which means dp[n] should be n - 1.\n\nThe simplest way to achieve this is with a list of identical non-zero elements. With such a list, each element forms its own subsequence, and the maximum length of a valid subsequence is 1.\n\nLet's try with a list containing a single element:\n\n```python\nassert findMaximumLength([1]) == 1\n```\n\nThis assertion should pass because:\n1. nums becomes [1, inf]\n2. n = 1 (length of original list)\n3. The main loop runs once, setting dp[1] = 0\n4. The function returns 1 - dp[1] = 1 - 0 = 1\n\nTherefore, a valid input that satisfies the given output is [1].",

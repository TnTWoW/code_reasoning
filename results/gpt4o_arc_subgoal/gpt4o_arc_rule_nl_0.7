Specifically, numbers should be pulled towards the middle, starting from the top left corner moving diagonally to the bottom right.\n\n3. **Additional Adjustments:**\n    - Ensure that any isolated numbers at the edges are also removed unless they form part of a distinct pattern that was shifted inward.\n\nThis rule effectively removes edge-aligned patterns while preserving any central structures or patterns within the grid."

If there is a gap between two 9s (i.e., `end - start > 1`), we fill the space between them with 8s.\n\nThis function will modify the input grid in place and return it with the spaces between horizontal pairs of 9s filled with 8s.",

We keep track of the row index with the highest sum.\n  \n- **Step 2**: Once we identify the row with the highest sum, we shift its elements to the right by one position. This is done by taking the last element and placing it at the front, followed by the rest of the elements.\n\n- **Step 3**: We create a copy of the original grid and replace the identified row with the modified row. This ensures that the original grid remains unchanged, and we return the new grid with the modified row.\n\nThis function assumes that the input is always a 5x5 grid, as specified in the problem statement.",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to implement a function `fn` that processes a 5x5 grid according to the specified rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify the 3x3 subgrid**: We need to find a 3x3 subgrid within the 5x5 grid that has a '7' in its center. This means we need to check each possible 3x3 subgrid in the 5x5 grid to see if the center element is '7'.\n\n2. **Shift the subgrid**: Once the correct 3x3 subgrid is identified, we need to move it to the top-center of the 5x5 grid. This means placing it starting from position (0,1).\n\n3. **Replace the central element**: In the identified 3x3 subgrid, replace the central '7' with one of the surrounding numbers. Since the problem statement suggests using the surrounding number, we can choose any of the surrounding numbers. For simplicity, we'll use the number directly above the '7'.\n\n4. **Fill remaining cells with zeros**: After placing the modified 3x3 subgrid in the top-center, fill the rest of the 5x5 grid with zeros.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef fn(grid):\n    # Step 1: Identify the 3x3 subgrid with '7' in the center\n    for i in range(1, 4):\n        for j in range(1, 4):\n            if grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # We found the center of the 3x3 subgrid\n                subgrid = [row[j-1:j+2] for row in grid[i-1:i+2]]\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    # Step 2: Shift the subgrid to the top-center of the 5x5 grid\n    # Step 3: Replace the central element (7) with the surrounding element\n    # We'll replace it with the element directly above it (subgrid[0][1])\n    subgrid[1][1] = subgrid[0][1]\n    \n    # Create a new 5x5 grid filled with zeros\n    new_grid = [[0] * 5 for _ in range(5)]\n    \n    # Place the modified subgrid at the top-center of the new grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            new_grid[i][j+1] = subgrid[i][j]\n    \n    return new_grid\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [4, 4, 7, 0, 0],\n    [4, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n    [4, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = fn(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis function will correctly identify the 3x3 subgrid with '7' in the center, shift it to the top-center of the grid, replace the '7' with a surrounding number, and fill the rest of the grid with zeros.",

The rows below it should follow in their original order.\n\n3. **Final Row of Twos**: The last row of the output grid should be filled entirely with the number 2.\n\nHere's the implementation of the function `fn`:\n\n```python\ndef fn(grid):\n    # Step 1: Identify the unique integer in the first column that is not 2 or 8\n    unique_value = None\n    for row in grid:\n        if row[0] != 2 and row[0] != 8:\n            unique_value = row[0]\n            break\n    \n    # Step 2: Reorder the rows\n    if unique_value is not None:\n        # Find the index of the row with the unique value\n        unique_row_index = next(i for i, row in enumerate(grid) if row[0] == unique_value)\n        \n        # Create the new grid with the unique row at the top\n        new_grid = [grid[unique_row_index]] + grid[unique_row_index + 1:]\n        \n        # Add the rows before the unique row\n        new_grid.extend(grid[:unique_row_index])\n    else:\n        # If no unique value is found, return the grid as is\n        new_grid = grid\n    \n    # Step 3: Set the last row to be all 2s\n    new_grid[-1] = [2] * len(grid[0])\n    \n    return new_grid\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_grid = [\n    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [7, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n    [2, 8, 0, 8, 0],\n    [8, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n]\n\noutput_grid = fn(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Finding the Unique Integer**: We iterate over each row and check the first column. The first integer that is neither 2 nor 8 is our unique integer.\n\n- **Reordering the Rows**: We find the index of the row containing the unique integer and construct a new grid with this row at the top. The rows below it are appended in their original order, followed by the rows above it.\n\n- **Final Row of Twos**: We replace the last row of the new grid with a row of 2s.\n\nThis function should work for any grid that follows the described pattern.",

Return the transformed grid.\n\nHere's the Python function that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef fn(grid):\n    # Check if the grid is empty or has less than 5 columns\n    if not grid or len(grid[0]) < 5:\n        raise ValueError(\"Grid must have at least 5 columns.\")\n    \n    # Create a new grid to store the transformed result\n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    for row in grid:\n        # Swap the first two columns with the last two columns\n        new_row = row[-2:] + row[2:3] + row[:2]\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_grid = [\n    [1, 2, 0, 4, 5],\n    [6, 7, 0, 9, 10],\n    [11, 12, 0, 14, 15]\n]\n\noutput_grid = fn(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the grid is empty or if it has fewer than 5 columns, raising an error if so. This is because the rule requires at least 5 columns to perform the swaps.\n  \n- **Transformation**: For each row in the grid, the function constructs a new row by:\n  - Taking the last two columns (`row[-2:]`).\n  - Adding the middle column (`row[2:3]`), which remains unchanged.\n  - Adding the first two columns (`row[:2]`).\n\n- **Output**: The function returns the transformed grid, which has the first two columns swapped with the last two columns, while the middle column remains unchanged.\n\nThis function assumes that the grid is well-formed and that each row has the same number of columns.

If not, it returns the grid unchanged because the rule cannot be applied.\n  \n- **Middle Row Calculation**: The middle row is determined by integer division of the number of rows by 2.\n\n- **Column Iteration**: The function iterates over each column in the middle row. For each column, it checks if the values in the rows directly above and below are the same as the value in the middle row.\n\n- **Replacement**: If the values match, the middle row's value in that column is replaced with 0.\n\nThis function assumes that the grid is well-formed, meaning all rows have the same number of columns. If the grid can have rows of different lengths, additional checks would be needed to handle such cases.",

        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to identify and remove isolated groups of non-zero integers that are completely surrounded by zeros, while retaining non-zero integers connected to the grid's border. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify isolated groups**: We need to find groups of connected non-zero integers. This can be done using a flood fill algorithm (similar to depth-first search or breadth-first search) to identify connected components.\n\n2. **Filter groups**: Once we have identified the groups, we need to check if any part of the group is connected to the grid's border. If a group is connected to the border, it should not be removed.\n\n3. **Remove isolated groups**: For groups that are not connected to the border, we set their elements to zero.\n\n4. **Retain border-connected elements**: Elements that are part of groups connected to the border are retained.\n\nHere's the Python function implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\ndef fn(grid):\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        return grid\n\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    def is_border(r, c):\n        return r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1\n\n    def dfs(r, c, group):\n        stack = [(r, c)]\n        group.append((r, c))\n        visited[r][c] = True\n        is_connected_to_border = is_border(r, c)\n\n        while stack:\n            x, y = stack.pop()\n            for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] != 0:\n                    visited[nx][ny] = True\n                    stack.append((nx, ny))\n                    group.append((nx, ny))\n                    if is_border(nx, ny):\n                        is_connected_to_border = True\n\n        return is_connected_to_border\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:\n                group = []\n                if not dfs(r, c, group):\n                    for x, y in group:\n                        grid[x][y] = 0\n\n    return grid\n\n# Example usage:\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n]\n\nresult = fn(grid)\nfor row in result:\n    print(row)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`is_border` function**: Checks if a given cell is on the border of the grid.\n- **`dfs` function**: Performs a depth-first search to find all connected non-zero cells starting from a given cell.

Identify the leftmost column containing the number '4' in the current row.\n2.

If no '4' is found, a `ValueError` is raised, and we skip to the next row.\n- **Shift '4's**: Starting from the rightmost position of the '4's, we move each '4' one position to the right. This is done by iterating from the end of the row to the leftmost '4' and swapping '4' with '0' to the right.\n- **Return the Modified Grid**: After processing all rows, the modified grid is returned.\n\nThis function will correctly shift the block of '4's one column to the right for each row containing '4's, as per the specified rule.",

Identify the most frequently occurring number in the input 2D grid.\n2. Replace all numbers in the grid with this most frequent number.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef fn(grid):\n    # Flatten the grid to a single list of numbers\n    flat_list = [num for row in grid for num in row]\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each number in the grid\n    frequency = Counter(flat_list)\n    \n    # Find the most frequently occurring number\n    most_frequent_number = max(frequency, key=frequency.get)\n    \n    # Create a new grid with the same dimensions, filled with the most frequent number\n    new_grid = [[most_frequent_number for _ in row] for row in grid]\n    \n    return new_grid\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_grid = [\n    [4, 4, 4, 6, 8],\n    [4, 2, 2, 6, 8],\n    [4, 6, 4, 6, 8],\n    [2, 2, 6, 8, 8],\n    [4, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n]\n\noutput_grid = fn(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **Flattening the Grid**: We first flatten the 2D grid into a 1D list using a list comprehension. This makes it easier to count the occurrences of each number.\n  \n- **Counting Frequencies**: We use Python's `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each number in the flattened list.\n\n- **Finding the Most Frequent Number**: We use the `max` function with the `key` parameter set to `frequency.get` to find the number with the highest frequency.\n\n- **Creating the New Grid**: We construct a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid, but filled entirely with the most frequent number.\n\nThis function will replace all numbers in the input grid with the most frequently occurring number, as specified by the rule.",

Rule: Identify the region of 4s that is fully surrounded by 4s and change the inner 4s to 6s, leaving the border of 4s intact.",
        "response": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the core area of 4s that is surrounded by a border of 4s and change the core area to 6s. The border of 4s should remain unchanged. Here's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef fn(grid):\n    if not grid or not grid[0]:\n        return grid\n\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n\n    # Create a copy of the grid to modify\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n\n    # Function to check if a cell is on the border\n    def is_border(r, c):\n        return r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1\n\n    # Iterate over the grid to find the core area\n    for r in range(1, rows - 1):\n        for c in range(1, cols - 1):\n            if grid[r][c] == 4:\n                # Check if the current 4 is surrounded by 4s\n                if (grid[r-1][c] == 4 and grid[r+1][c] == 4 and\n                    grid[r][c-1] == 4 and grid[r][c+1] == 4):\n                    # Change the core 4 to 6\n                    result[r][c] = 6\n\n    return result\n\n# Test cases\nprint(fn([[4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]))\n# Output: [[4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [4, 6, 6, 4, 0], [4, 6, 6, 4, 0], [4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nprint(fn([[4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]))\n# Output: [[4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [4, 6, 4, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nprint(fn([[4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]))\n# Output: [[4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 6, 6, 6, 4], [4, 6, 6, 6, 4], [4, 6, 6, 6, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Grid Copy**: We create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original grid while iterating over it.\n2. **Border Check**: We define a helper function `is_border` to check if a cell is on the border of the grid. However, in this solution, we don't use it directly because we only iterate over non-border cells.\n3. **Core Identification**: We iterate over each cell in the grid, excluding the border cells. For each cell that contains a 4, we check if it is surrounded by 4s on all four sides (up, down, left, right).\n4. **Modification**: If a cell is surrounded by 4s, we change it to 6 in the result grid.\n5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the modified grid.\n\nThis approach ensures that only the core area of 4s is changed to 6s, while the border remains intact.",

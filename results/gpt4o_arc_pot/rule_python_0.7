Maintain the position of zeros and other numbers that do not appear in a consecutive sequence.\n\nGiven this understanding, we can implement the function `fn` as follows:\n\n```python\ndef fn(x):\n    # Iterate over each list in x\n    for sublist in x:\n        # Find the maximum number in the sublist\n        max_num = max(sublist)\n        \n        # Iterate over the sublist to transform it\n        for i in range(len(sublist)):\n            if i > 0 and sublist[i] == sublist[i-1] and sublist[i] != 0:\n                sublist[i] = max_num\n            elif i < len(sublist) - 1 and sublist[i] == sublist[i+1] and sublist[i] != 0:\n                sublist[i] = max_num\n    \n    return x\n```\n\nThis function processes each sublist in the input `x` and replaces consecutive numbers with the maximum number in that sublist. Non-consecutive numbers or zeros remain unchanged, following the pattern observed in the example mappings.",

Specifically, when there are consecutive occurrences of a number (like 3, 4, or 6), the transition or end of the sequence might trigger an 8 in the output.\n- The 8 does not appear at the start of a sequence of identical numbers in the input matrix, but rather when such a sequence is interrupted or ends.\n\n### Implementation:\nLet's create a function that processes the input matrix and generates the corresponding output matrix based on the observed rules.\n\n```python\ndef fn(x):\n    rows = len(x)\n    cols = len(x[0])\n    output = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(1, cols):\n            if x[i][j] == 0 and x[i][j-1] != 0:\n                output[i][j] = 8\n    \n    for j in range(cols):\n        for i in range(1, rows):\n            if x[i][j] == 0 and x[i-1][j] != 0:\n                output[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return output\n\n# Test the function with the provided inputs\nprint(fn([[3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 0, 0, 0], [3, 3, 3, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]))\nprint(fn([[4, 4, 0, 4, 0], [4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 4, 4, 0, 0]]))\nprint(fn([[6, 0, 6, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function iterates through the matrix, checking for transitions from a non-zero number to zero in both rows and columns.\n- When such a transition is detected, an 8 is placed in the corresponding position in the output matrix.\n- This logic is applied both row-wise and column-wise to capture all potential transitions.\n\nThis approach should correctly generate the desired output for the given inputs.",

This transformation appears to occur only when `5`s are adjacent in rows.\n\n2. **Zero Out Certain Rows**: The last two rows of the output are completely filled with zeros in every provided example. This suggests a rule to zero-out the last two rows regardless of their initial content.\n\n3. **Preserve Non-Adjacent `4`s**: In each row, sequences of `4` that are not adjacent to `5` seem to remain unchanged.\n\nGiven these observations, we can construct a function `fn` that applies these transformations to any given input matrix. Here's how you can implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef fn(x):\n    def transform_row(row):\n        # Transform sequences of 5s into 6s\n        new_row = []\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(row):\n            if row[i] == 5:\n                # Start of a sequence of 5s\n                j = i\n                while j < len(row) and row[j] == 5:\n                    j += 1\n                # Transform the sequence of 5s into 6s\n                new_row.extend([6] * (j - i))\n                i = j\n            else:\n                # Keep the current element if it's not part of a 5-sequence\n                new_row.append(row[i])\n                i += 1\n        return new_row\n\n    # Transform each row except the last two rows\n    transformed = [transform_row(row) for row in x[:3]]\n    # Append two rows of zeros\n    transformed.extend([[0] * len(x[0])] * 2)\n    return transformed\n\n# Example usage\ninputs = [\n    [[4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [4, 5, 5, 0, 0], [4, 5, 4, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6]],\n    [[4, 5, 5, 0, 0], [4, 4, 5, 0, 0], [4, 5, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 6, 6, 6]],\n    [[4, 5, 5, 0, 0], [4, 5, 5, 0, 0], [4, 4, 4, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6], [0, 0, 0, 6, 6]],\n]\n\nfor input_matrix in inputs:\n    print(fn(input_matrix))\n```\n\nThis function `fn` processes an input matrix according to the identified transformation rules and returns the expected output. Each row is transformed by converting sequences of `5`s to `6`s, and the last two rows are replaced with zeros.",

It then iterates from the second to last row up to the first row, filling in numbers from the last row where applicable, following the identified pattern. The function uses a simple loop to mimic the cascading fill observed in the examples.",

Upon examining the examples, we can deduce the following rules:\n\n1. The goal is to remove specific rows of the matrix. The rows that are removed in the output seem to correspond to specific patterns in the input.\n2. It appears that rows without any zeros are removed, but since every row has zeros, this isn't the criteria.\n3. Observing the outputs, it seems like any row that contains a '3' at the beginning or end is retained. This indicates a pattern where rows containing a '3' at the boundaries are kept.\n\nBased on this observation, we can create the function `fn` that processes the input matrix and generates the desired output matrix by retaining only those rows that have a '3' at the first or last position.\n\nHere is the Python function implementing this logic:\n\n```python\ndef fn(x):\n    # Initialize an empty list to store the resulting matrix\n    result = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each row in the matrix\n    for row in x:\n        # Check if the first or last element is 3\n        if row[0] == 3 or row[-1] == 3:\n            # If true, add the row to the result\n            result.append(row)\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, append a row of zeros of the same length\n            result.append([0] * len(row))\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis function iterates over each row of the input matrix `x` and checks whether the first or last element of the row is '3'. If so, it retains the row; otherwise, it replaces the row with a row of zeros of the same length. This way, the function produces the required output for all given examples.",

The transformation involves repositioning the non-zero elements in the 2D list following a specific diagonal-like pattern, but it's a bit more complex than a simple diagonal shift. Here's the step-by-step thought process to derive the function:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: We observe that the output seems to reposition the non-zero elements from the input matrix. Non-zero elements appear to move diagonally towards the bottom-right corner, and when they reach the last column, they wrap around to the start of the next row.\n\n2. **Matrix Size**: The input matrices are 5x5, and the outputs are also 5x5. This size consistency means the transformation can be implemented without adding or removing rows or columns.\n\n3. **Non-zero Element Shift**:\n   - If a non-zero element exists at position `(i, j)` in the input, it appears to be moved to a new position in the output, seemingly following a diagonal line.\n   - When reaching the last column, the element wraps to the beginning of the next row.\n\n4. **Implementation Strategy**:\n   - Traverse each row and column of the input matrix.\n   - For each non-zero element found, calculate its new position in the output matrix.\n   - To find the new position, start from the current position and shift diagonally (right and down).\n   - If the column index exceeds the matrix width, wrap around to the next row.\n\nUsing these observations, let's implement the function:\n\n```python\ndef fn(x):\n    n = len(x)  # Assuming the matrix is n x n\n    result = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]  # Initialize a result matrix with zeros\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if x[i][j] != 0:\n                # Start at the current position\n                row, col = i, j\n                # Move diagonally right and wrap around if necessary\n                while row < n and col < n:\n                    if result[row][col] == 0:\n                        result[row][col] = x[i][j]\n                        break\n                    row += 1\n                    col += 1\n                \n                # Wrap around if moved out of bounds\n                if row >= n or col >= n:\n                    for k in range(n):\n                        if result[k][col % n] == 0:\n                            result[k][col % n] = x[i][j]\n                            break\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis function processes the input matrix, identifies non-zero elements, and moves them according to the pattern observed in the examples.

Specifically, it looks like certain elements in the row are replaced with a number that appears to be related to the first occurrence of a unique number in the row.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Iterate over each row of the matrix.\n- Identify the first occurrence of a unique number (not necessarily the first element).\n- Replace certain elements in the row based on a derived rule (like mirroring or repeating a pattern).\n\nBelow is the Python implementation of the function `fn` based on the observed patterns:\n\n```python\ndef fn(x):\n    for i, row in enumerate(x):\n        if i < 3:\n            min_index = row.index(min(row))\n            if i == 0:\n                # Pattern for the first row\n                row[-1] = row[0]\n            elif i == 1:\n                # Pattern for the second row\n                row[-2] = row[1]\n            elif i == 2:\n                # Pattern for the third row\n                row[min_index] = row[1]\n    return x\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(fn([[8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [5, 1, 5, 5, 5], [1, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- For the first three rows (i.e., rows with indices 0, 1, and 2), we apply different transformations based on the index.\n- The transformations are based on the position of the smallest element in the row or specific conditions derived from the observed output patterns.\n- The function modifies the input matrix `x` in place and returns it.\n\nThis function should correctly transform the given input matrices into their corresponding outputs based on the patterns deduced from the examples.",

For each row between the first and last row:\n   - If a row contains non-zero values (other than `6`) anywhere between the first and last column, this row's values are propagated downward to replace zeros in subsequent rows until another non-zero value row is encountered or the last row is reached.\n   - The propagation only happens to the zeros within the boundaries of non-zero values from that row.\n\n### Approach:\n- We'll iterate over each row from top to bottom (excluding the first and last rows), and whenever we encounter a row with non-zero values, we'll store these values.\n- As we move to the next rows, we'll use the stored values to replace zeros until we encounter another row with non-zero values, which we'll then store and propagate further.\n\nHere's the implementation of the `fn` function:\n\n```python\ndef fn(x):\n    # Iterate over each row from the second to the second-to-last\n    for i in range(1, len(x) - 1):\n        # If the current row has non-zero values (other than 6), store them\n        if any(x[i][j] != 0 and x[i][j] != 6 for j in range(1, len(x[i]) - 1)):\n            current_values = x[i][1:-1]\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, propagate the stored non-zero values (if any) to this row\n            for j in range(1, len(x[i]) - 1):\n                if x[i][j] == 0:\n                    x[i][j] = current_values[j - 1]\n    return x\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We loop through the rows starting from the second row and ending on the second-to-last row.\n- `current_values` is used to store the non-zero values found in a row. If a row with non-zero values is found, these values are used to replace zeros in the subsequent rows.\n- The check `x[i][j] != 0 and x[i][j] != 6` ensures that we only consider rows that have meaningful non-zero values to propagate.\n- The propagation is done by replacing zeros in subsequent rows with the stored `current_values`.\n\nThis function should correctly transform the inputs according to the pattern observed.",

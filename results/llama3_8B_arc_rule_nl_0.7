This is because we'll be rotating each row clockwise by one position, so the new grid needs to have the same number of columns but a different number of rows.\n2. We iterate over each element in the input grid. For each element, we set the corresponding element in the new grid to the rotated and flipped value.\n3.

The output is also a nested list that represents a 2D grid of integers.\n\nRule: In the input grid, replace each group of consecutive pixels with the same color by the number of pixels in that group plus one, and then rotate the resulting grid 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nFor example, the first input grid has a group of 5 pixels with the color 4, so it becomes 5 in the output grid. The second input grid has two groups of 4 pixels with the color 4, and one group of 1 pixel with the color 0, so it becomes 4 and 6 in the output grid, respectively.",
        "response": "Here is the Python function `fn` that follows the given rule:\n\n```python\ndef fn(grid):\n    # Flatten the grid and group consecutive pixels with the same color\n    flat_grid = [pixel for row in grid for pixel in row]\n    grouped_grid = [(pixel, 1) if i == 0 or pixel!= flat_grid[i-1] else (pixel, grouped_grid[i-1][1]+1) for i, pixel in enumerate(flat_grid)]\n    \n    # Convert the grouped grid back to a 2D grid\n    result = []\n    current_row = []\n    for pixel, count in grouped_grid:\n        current_row.append(count)\n        if (len(current_row) == len(grid[0]) or pixel!= flat_grid[grouped_grid.index((pixel, count))+1][0]):\n            result.append(current_row)\n            current_row = []\n    if current_row:\n        result.append(current_row)\n    \n    # Rotate the resulting grid 90 degrees clockwise\n    rotated_grid = list(map(list, zip(*result[::-1])))\n    \n    return rotated_grid\n```\n\nYou can test this function with the following code:\n\n```python\ngrid1 = [[4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n        ",
